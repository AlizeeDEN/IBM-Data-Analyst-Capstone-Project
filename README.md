# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this capstone project, I applied various data analytics skills and techniques learned from the [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst), to answer these questions:

- What are the top programming languages in demand?

- What are the top database skills in demand?

- What are the popular IDEs?

### **Part 1 : Data Collection**
Data collection is the first step in solving any analysis problem and can be gathered in many formats and from various sources. In the first module of the Capstone, I collected data by scraping the internet and using web APIs.

### **Part 2 : Data Wrangling**
In this module, I focused on cleaning the dataset using various techniques. I identified duplicate rows, found missing values, and normalized the data.

### **Part 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis**
In this module, I began working with the cleaned dataset from the previous module. I analyzed the dataset to find the distribution of data, presence of outliers, and the correlation between different columns.

### **Part 4 : Data Visualization**
In module 4 of the Capstone, I created visualizations using the developer survey data. These visualizations highlighted the distribution of data, relationships between data, the composition of data, and comparisons within the data.

### **Part 5 : Building A Dashboard**
In this module, I created a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics. This platform allowed me to create various charts and assemble a dashboard that is appealing and easy to understand. My dashboard contained my data analysis, which was intuitive and allowed for the drill-down of data.

### **Part 6 : Present My Findings**
After analyzing the data in the previous modules, it was time to demonstrate my storytelling skills. In this module, I created a compelling story that clarified my analysis in an easy-to-understand presentation.

## About the dataset
Stack Overflow conducted an online survey of software professionals across the world. The survey data was later open sourced by Stack Overflow. The actual data set has around 90,000 responses.

The dataset I mainly used in this assignment comes from the following source: https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/ under a [ODbL: Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/).

**Note: I received a subset of the original dataset as part of this final capstone project. This random subset contains approximately 1/10th of the original dataset. The conclusions I have drawn after analysing this subset may not reflect the actual scenario.**
